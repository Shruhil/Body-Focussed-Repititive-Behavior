# Body-Focussed-Repititive-Behavior
Introduction

Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) are compulsive self-grooming behaviors such as hair-pulling, skin-picking, and nail-biting. These behaviors may cause physical damage, psychological distress, and functional impairment. This repository provides research-oriented code for experimentation, computational modeling, and detection of BFRBs. The implementation supports scientific studies related to behavior identification, sensor-based monitoring, and data-driven analysis.
