# Body-Focussed-Repetitive-Behavior (BFRB)

## Introduction
Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) are compulsive self-grooming actions such as hair-pulling, skin-picking, and nail-biting. These behaviors may cause physical damage, psychological distress, and functional impairment. This repository provides research-oriented code designed to support experimentation, computational modeling, behavioral analysis, and detection of BFRBs. The implementation supports scientific investigation for behavior identification, sensor-based monitoring, and data-driven research.

This codebase is referenced in an academic research publication and is developed with a focus on reproducibility and scientific transparency.
